A sector is the portion of a disk enclosed by two radii and an arc, where the smaller area is known as the minor sector and the larger being the major sector.

#### Terminology

Radius (r) - The length of a line from any point on the boundary/cirumference of the circle to the centre of the circle is known as the radius of the circle.

Diameter (d) - The length of the line that passes across the circle through the centre of the circle, is called the diameter.

Pi (π) - A mathematical constant which is approximated as 3.14

Arc - A connected section of the circumference of a circle. 

Circumference (C) - The enclosing boundary of the circle is called circumference of the circle.

Theta (θ) - The angle formed by the two radii forming the sector.

#### Formula

###### Given radius of the circle and theta (θ) 

Area of sector = <span class="texhtml"><span class="texhtml">π</span> * <i>radius</i><sup>2</sup> * θ / 360 </span> 

###### Given diameter of the circle and theta (θ) 

We know that `diameter = 2 * radius`, so you can derive the area of the sector as below,

Area of sector =  <span class="texhtml"><span class="texhtml">π</span> * <i>(diameter/2)</i><sup>2</sup> * θ / 360 </span>

###### Given radius and arc length (L)

Area of sector = <span class="texhtml"> R * L / 2 </span>
  
#### Examples

1. Given radius = 3cm and θ = 60°, find area of the sector

     Area = 3.14 * 9 * 60 / 360 = 4.71 <span>cm<sup>2</sup></span>

2. Given diameter = 8cm and θ = 30°, find area of the sector

     Radius = (Diameter/2) = 4cm

     Area = 3.14 * 16 * 30 / 360 = 4.18 <span>cm<sup>2</sup></span>
     
3. Given length of the arc = 20cm and radius = 4cm, find area of the sector

     Area = 20 * 4 / 2 = 40 <span>cm<sup>2</sup></span>
